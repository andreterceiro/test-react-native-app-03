# General

The content of the tag v0.1.0 is very simple:

1- I created the project with the command:

```
npx create-expo-app test-app-2 -t
```

2- Next I created the 2 screens (GalleryScreen and HomeScreen).

3- Next I imported these screens in App.tsx and used them in App.tsx, with an external View component.
